Course Syllabus for "PHIL103: Moral and Political Philosophy"
-------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the basic concepts and methods of
moral and political philosophy.  Its primary focus is on the development
of moral reasoning skills and the application of those skills to
contemporary social and political issues.  Although the course is
organized around the central concept of *justice*, it uses this notion
as a point of departure for discussing a wide range of philosophical
topics and perspectives. Topics range from the value of human life, the
moral standing of the free market, and the notion of fundamental human
rights, to equality of opportunity, the legality of same-sex marriage,
and the conditions for a moral community.  In order to investigate these
topics, this course makes extensive use of Professor Michael Sandel’s
video lecture course on justice, delivered at Harvard University in
2009.  In addition to these lectures, you will study a number of
important moral and political philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle,
John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel
Kant, Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche, and John Rawls. 
Supplementary readings will include texts from contemporary
philosophers, such as Robert Nozick, John Finnis, Alasdair MacIntyre,
and others, as well as news articles and primary source texts regarding
important legal decisions.  By the end of the course, you will have
gained a detailed understanding of the philosophical issues involved in
many contemporary debates in the public sphere, as well as a refined
sense of your own moral and political positions and intuitions.

Welcome to PHIL103. Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   YouTube: **WGBH Educational Foundation and Harvard University:
    Professor Michael Sandel’s** [“Justice: What’s the Right Thing to
    Do?”](http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC30C13C91CFFEFEA6)

 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all its assigned materials. This
includes participating in the discussion board activities at the end of
each unit. You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all the course readings, lectures, web media, and
activities in each unit.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **105.25
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 18.5 hours to complete.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunits 1.1–1.4 (a total of 2.75 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.5 (a
total of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; and so forth.
