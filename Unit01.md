**Unit 1: Murder, Morality, and the Value of Human Life** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Everyone – whether they realize it or not – has some beliefs about the
differences between right and wrong, or good and bad.  We use these
beliefs to guide our behavior, judge the behavior of others, and decide
on laws and punishments in our society.  Sometimes, however, situations
arise that force us to call our moral beliefs into question and to
debate the truth about moral behavior with our peers.  It is usually the
really difficult cases, in which the right thing to do is difficult to
decide, and cases which divide people against one another in their
opinions, that bring the differences in our moral intuitions into focus
and force us to clarify our moral principles. ­­*  
  
 *In this unit, we will investigate some notoriously difficult and
divisive moral dilemmas involving justice, rights, and the value of
human life.  We will also introduce the moral theory of utilitarianism,
see if it can help us decide about the right thing to do, and inform us
of how to produce a just society.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain the intrinsic value of philosophical investigation as an
    academic discipline, define ethics/moral philosophy, and apply your
    understanding of ethics/moral philosophy to centrally important
    concepts like *justice*.
-   Discuss as well as compare and contrast utilitarian theories (as
    exemplified by Bentham and Mill) and Kantian ethical theory.
-   Identify and describe central issues in ethics, including moral
    skepticism and reflective equilibrium.
-   Analyze how an ethical theory may influence policies in corporations
    and institutions, and how an ethical theory may affect individual
    rights and liberties.

**1.1 What Is Ethics/Moral Philosophy?** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Note: Because we will be dealing extensively with moral and political
dilemmas in this course, it will help to know what ethics is all about.
 Ethics, also called* *moral philosophy, is the area of philosophy that
deals with questions about values and norms (i.e. questions of right and
wrong, good and bad, rights and obligations).*

     Instructions: Read this summary of the famous Queen v. Dudley and
    Stephens case.  As you read, consider if you agree with the ruling
    in this case, and if you would rule differently, as well as why you
    would do so.  This text discusses the famous *lifeboat case*, which
    established the legality of choosing to murder out of necessity. 
    Although the details of the case are quite graphic, this fact itself
    may serve as a prompt for many of us to revise our initial
    intuitions about the moral status of killing one to save many
    others.

     Instructions: Read this 1780 text, in which Bentham justifies the
    principle that the morality of our actions depends on the
    consequences produced.  The late eighteenth and early nineteenth
    century English philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was the first to
    formalize the moral principle that whether our actions are right or
    wrong is a matter of the consequences they produce (i.e. how much
    happiness and how much unhappiness results from them).  It is
    important to note that, although Bentham places a lot of emphasis on
    the pleasure and pain experienced by the individual person, he is
    not recommending that our laws should be guided purely by individual
    hedonism, but by a collective responsibility to improve the
    happiness of everyone in society.

    subunit 1.10.  Here, Professor Sandel introduces some important
    objections to Bentham’s version of utilitarianism.  If Bentham is
    right about utility being measurable, and even quantifiable, then
    this would seem to justify the practices of some governments and
    corporations in taking a dollars and cents approach to human life,
    which strikes many people as being in itself unethical.

     Instructions: Read this 1977 article from *Mother Jones* magazine. 
    While you read, consider the following question: do detached
    calculations, such as the cost-benefit analysis that Ford performed
    to determine whether it should fix a dangerous problem with one of
    its cars, miss the point of moral reasoning and become immoral
    practices in and of itself?   
        
     This article provides details of the case of the Ford Pinto, which
    sold cars despite a known safety hazard.  This case is usually
    presented in order to illustrate a criticism of the utilitarian
    concept of *utility calculus*.  Some utilitarians like Jeremy
    Bentham felt that utility and goods could be counted up and
    quantified as *hedons* like degrees on a thermometer.  More recent
    utilitarians have argued that goods are not only quantitative but
    also qualitative, meaning that the quality of the good, utility or
    pleasure achieved must be considered too.  This is the concept
    behind John Stuart Mill’s saying that it is better to be Socrates
    dissatisfied than a pig satisfied: Socrates asks deeper questions
    and lives a higher quality of life than the pig does, even if he
    remains unsatisfied in seeking deeper answers.

     Despite some powerful objections raised against it, some version of
    utilitarianism still seems plausible, since it seems to explain a
    large number of cases to our satisfaction.  In this lecture,
    Professor Sandel introduces John Stuart Mill’s *improved* version of
    utilitarianism, which attempts to reconcile a consequentialist
    ethical principle with the notion of individual and minority rights.
     The importance of a well-informed majority for Mill’s view raises
    questions that are fundamental to the success of a democratic
    society.

    “Section 2: The Classical Approach” with its subsections on Jeremy
    Bentham and John Stuart Mill.  This article will help you understand
    in more detail why Bentham is usually classified as an *act
    utilitarian,* who focused on quantities of pleasure or happiness,
    while John Stuart Mill is usually classified as a *rule
    utilitarian*, who advises us to focus on rules that bring about
    high-quality utility in general.

     Instructions: Read Chapters 1–3 of this 1863 text by Mill.  In his
    text, Mill lays out the basic principles of his version of
    utilitarianism and distinguishes it from Bentham’s account as well
    as other competing moral theories.  Mill attempts to rescue the
    utilitarian *pleasure principle* from Bentham’s more hedonistic
    formulation by introducing the notion of intellectual pleasure and
    the idea that the majority can accept some degree of dissatisfaction
    in order to protect the rights of individuals.

     Instructions: Read Chapters 4 and 5 of Mill’s text.  Here, Mill
    provides arguments that his theory can be empirically proven and
    identifies justice as the principle aim of a truly moral society. 
    Because of the way that he has defined morality in terms of pleasure
    and identified intellectual pleasures as inherently more valuable
    than sensual ones, a just society may be one in which some
    individuals must make sacrifices, but overall happiness is
    maximized.  Studying this reading should take approximately 2 hours

    Feel free to start your own related posts, and respond to other
    students’ postings as well.  
      
     1. One of the famous examples of utilitarian ethics is known as
    *lifeboat ethics*.  Imagine you are on a sinking ship with many
    other people.  Five people rush to get on a lifeboat, and it only
    holds four people safely.  One of you will have to get off the
    lifeboat.  As a utilitarian, how would you decide if the people
    include you, your beloved mother, a world-famous heart surgeon who
    will save many lives, a world famous violinist whose music brings
    joy to many, and the single unwed parent of 10 children who
    desperately need their parent (and who may grow up to do terrible
    things without their parent in their life)?  
      
     2. What are the disadvantages and advantages of *population
    control* for the utilitarian ethicist?  If we have fewer people,
    will that negatively affect production and supplying food?  If we
    have too many people, will that tax our resources too much?  How
    should the utilitarian decide about population control?  
        
     3. Imagine you are the mayor of a town.  A power company wants to
    build a biomass incinerator in your town.  It will bring many new
    jobs, but it will also raise the level of air pollution in your
    community.  How should you decide what to do with the power company,
    following utilitarian ethics?
