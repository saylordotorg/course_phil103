**Unit 2: Rights, the State, and the Free Market** <span id="2"></span> 
*So far, we have only considered theories of just action that base their
criteria for justice on an action’s consequences.  Utilitarianism, as we
have seen, provides a convincing justification for many of our moral
intuitions, but even its more refined versions, such as the theory
advanced by John Stuart Mill, start to seem unsatisfying once we realize
that they reduce moral decisions to detached, rational calculations.  If
we want a completely adequate theory of just action, we need to consider
an alternative approach to justice and morality, one that promises to
succeed in precisely the ways that utilitarianism fails.  This approach
is captured by the political and economic position of libertarianism,
which understands morality and justice as rooted in the natural rights
of individual human beings.  Consequences matter, of course, but they
are always secondary to considerations of natural rights.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will become familiar with several arguments involving
the individual citizen’s relationship to the state.  Plato, in the
dialogue known as the* *Crito, gives arguments that claim the individual
does not have a right to defy his or her government.  In contrast,
contemporary proponents of libertarianism – much as Milton Friedman and
Robert Nozick – as well as the eighteenth century wellspring of
rights-based political philosophy – such as with philosopher John Locke
– uphold individual rights and liberties.  John Locke argues that the
contract we have with our government can always be rescinded.  In order
to evaluate the appropriateness of libertarianism, we will also consider
several cases in which rights and consequences come into conflict with
one another.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and view this entire
    lecture, which gives a background for the social and political
    theory given by Plato in the dialogue between Socrates and Crito. 
    Socrates explains to Crito why he feels that he must remain in
    prison and carry out the death sentence of the court of Athens. 
    Crito hopes that Socrates will simply leave Athens and go to live in
    another Greek city-state like Sparta.  Socrates feels this would be
    wrong; above all, Socrates respects the law (the government and the
    courts of Athens).  To disobey the law is wrong, even if he feels
    the death sentence they gave him is unfair.

    the most famous statements of Plato’s metaphysics – usually called
    the *theory of forms*.  Book VI focuses on his *analogies of the
    sun* and the *divided line*, which set up his famous *allegory of
    the cave* in Book VII.  Plato argues that it is philosophers who
    have the best access to the forms (i.e. to reality) and are
    therefore best suited to govern the state.  The need for rulers to
    have knowledge or wisdom is a recurring theme in both Eastern and
    Western thought.

     Instructions: Watch the first half of this video until the lecture
    break at 27:15.  You will watch the second half of the lecture in
    subunit 2.4.  Professor Sandel introduces the position of
    libertarianism as an alternative to utilitarianism.  Notice that the
    everyday understanding of libertarianism may or may not match what
    philosophers mean by libertarianism: while there is a libertarian
    political party in the United States, the Stanford Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy defines libertarianism as a specific moral or ethical
    view, which assumes that agents have self-ownership and the freedom
    to acquire property rights and external goods and status.  We have
    just seen how Mill argues that we should respect individual rights
    because it is good for the whole of society in the long run.  In
    other words, Mill holds that individual rights are to be valued for
    their utility.  Libertarianism, by contrast, assigns a more
    fundamental role to individual rights, holding that they should be
    valued in and of themselves, and because of this, the state should
    be limited in its power to restrict our right to individual
    liberty.

     In this lecture, Professor Sandel introduces the question of
    taxation as a test for the libertarian view of individual rights.
     Taxation is a case in which the state redistributes property
    (money) throughout society.

    John Locke.  Locke’s idea that human beings have certain fundamental
    rights (life, liberty, and property) by virtue of a natural law has
    supplied a central justification for the legal protection of
    individual rights, since he advanced it in the late seventeenth
    century.  Professor Sandel also takes pains to place Locke’s views
    in relation to those of contemporary libertarians.

     Instructions: Read Chapters II and V of Locke’s 1690 text about the
    formation of a just state.  Locke’s conception of the state of
    nature is an important thought experiment in political philosophy. 
    A *thought experiment* is a hypothetical situation that is meant to
    illustrate a deeper philosophical truth or insight.  Locke’s *state
    of nature* thought experiment tries to show that the formation of a
    state is a natural consequence of the way human beings are, prior to
    the existence of any form of political organization.  Chapter V is
    the part that is most relevant to our discussion of property rights.
     Locke argues that a human being’s self is his own property as well
    as anything with which he mixes his labor.

     Instructions: Start the video after the lecture break  at 25:49. 
    Consider the following question as you watch the second half of this
    video lecture: if taxes are part of a government system instead of a
    state of nature, then why should we have to pay them?  
        
     Professor Sandel uses Locke’s account of natural rights and state
    formation in order to reassess the question of whether taxation
    amounts to an infringement of an individual’s natural right to his
    or her property.  For Locke, natural rights are something that we
    possess inherently from the state of nature.  Taxes are part of a
    system of government that comes after that natural state.  Compare
    Sandel and Locke’s ideas on the consent of the governed to the
    notion of obedience to the state given in the *Crito* dialogue in
    subunit 2.1.

     Instructions: Read Chapters VII-XI of Locke’s *Second Treatise of
    Government. * In these chapters, Locke describes how human beings
    moved from the state of nature to the first, basic forms of social
    and political organization.  What is most important here is that
    these early societies formed by the mutual consent of a majority of
    their members, because they are better off for doing so.  As a
    result, however, individuals cede certain  rights to the state, such
    as the right to punish wrongdoers.  Here, we finally get Locke’s
    answer to the question of taxation: it is unjust for the government
    to take a man’s property without his consent.  Therefore, any just
    system of taxation must be based on the consent of the majority.

     Instructions: Read Chapters XVIII and XIX of Locke’s *Second
    Treatise of Government. * In these final sections of Locke’s
    treatise, he draws out some of the consequences of his theory of
    government based on natural, individual rights.  Predictably, he
    argues that if a government fails to respect these rights, it is
    rightly understood as a tyranny and should be opposed, even
    undermined, by the people.

     Instructions: After reviewing the unit materials, please post and
    respond to the following topics on the course discussion board. 
    Feel free to start your own related posts, and respond to other
    students’ postings as well.  
      
     1. One of the most controversial areas of government power in
    recent years is *eminent domain* law.  In eminent domain cases, a
    family may find themselves without their home, because their local
    government decides it is needed for a new building project or oil
    pipeline.  Given what you now know about Locke’s theory of property,
    is this a legitimate power of the government?  Why, or why not? 
    Explain your response.  
      
     2. Is the theory of property advanced by Locke the only possible
    theory of property?  Consider how Locke’s theory relates to Native
    American conceptions of man’s relationship to the land.  Is it
    possible that Locke’s theory can be misused to justify inappropriate
    policies?  
        
     3. A complicated area of international law involves intellectual
    property rights.  Some argue that with the advent of the internet,
    material should be made more widely available and intellectual
    property should become an outdated concept.  Do you agree or
    disagree, given the theories of property and labor in this unit?  
      
     Posting and responding on the discussion board should take
    approximately 5 hours to complete.
