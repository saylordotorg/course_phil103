**Unit 3: Morality, Markets, and Immanuel Kant** <span id="3"></span> 
*John Locke and the libertarian philosophers he inspired hold that
justice and morality are a matter of respecting the fundamental rights
that all individuals hold in common – life, liberty, and property
(including the property of one’s self).  Libertarians like Milton
Friedman argue that these principles are incompatible with the
government placing restrictions on the free market.  But what happens
when the market itself brings our rights into conflict with one
another?*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine several case studies in which individual
rights are disputed, and we will consider whether these cases provide
sufficient reason to doubt the libertarian position.  We will also
introduce the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which – although
difficult in its formulation – presents a convincing alternative to both
utilitarian and libertarian theories of morality and justice.*

     Instructions: Watch the first half of this video until the lecture
    break at 27:00.  You will view the second part of the lecture in
    subunit 3.2.  Consider the following question as you watch the
    lecture: is it an abuse of the government’s power for it to order
    citizens to risk their lives in the military?    
        
     In this lecture, Professor Sandel calls the libertarian conception
    of self-ownership, along with the Lockean conception of consent,
    into question by confronting it with the controversial case of
    military conscription.  The problem is further complicated by the
    fact that military conflicts take place within a market economy.
     This aspect of the problem is brought out in the Civil War practice
    in which the wealthy hired less affluent citizens to fight in their
    place.

    Then, watch the remainder of the video lecture.  While you watch the
    video, consider this question: Whose rights take precedence, those
    of the mother, or those of the child?   
        
     Motherhood immediately presents a complication to the general
    theory of natural rights.  Everyone who is familiar with the debate
    over abortion knows this.  The matter becomes yet more complicated
    when motherhood, and in a sense, children, are exchanged on the free
    market.  In this lecture, Professor Sandel introduces the case of
    Baby M, in which a surrogate mother’s claim to the baby she has
    carried came into conflict with the claim of the baby’s biological
    father.

     Instructions: Read this ruling by the Supreme Court of New Jersey
    in the 1988 case of Baby M.  This reading helps to supplement the
    introduction to this case in Sandel’s lecture above.  This case is
    about the fight between the baby’s surrogate mother and biological
    father for custody.  The surrogacy contract, according to which the
    woman agreed to carry the child of another couple for $10,000, was
    invalidated by the court as “potentially degrading to women,” and
    the court took itself to be protecting “the best interests of the
    child.”  The case remains controversial, however, since it fails to
    settle the question as to whether there ought to be legal
    limitations to a woman’s ownership of her body.

    approach to morality: Immanuel Kant’s deontological or *duty-based*
    ethics.  In contrast to the utilitarians, Kant holds that an
    action’s consequences are not what make it right or wrong, but
    rather the principle on which the action was based.  Kant’s view is
    similar to Locke’s in that he ascribes fundamental rights to
    persons, but what really sets Kant apart is his insistence that even
    if we do the right thing, we still have not acted morally unless we
    have also done it for the right reason.

     Instructions: Read the entire “Preface” and “First Section” of
    Kant’s 1785 text about morality.  What Kant argues here is that the
    only absolutely good thing in the world is good will, or the human
    desire to act morally, and that this desire is only possible for us
    because we are rational beings.  According to Kant, we have an
    absolute duty to act on the basis of the moral principles that are
    the result of our own rationality.  This is, in fact, what separates
    us from the animals, and it is why Kant so opposes the utilitarian
    view, which seems to make human beings into the slaves of their
    desires for pleasure and to avoid pain.

    utilitarians.  Professor Sandel helpfully breaks down some of the
    complexity of Kant’s moral philosophy by illustrating the major
    contrasts that Kant uses to develop it.  Although he gives three
    different versions of it, Kant thinks of his categorical imperative
    as a singular rational principle for deciding how to act.  As long
    as we follow the categorical imperative, we are acting out of duty,
    and we are respecting ourselves and others as rational beings.

     Instructions: Read the entire “Second Section” of Kant’s text. 
    Unlike the method we have been employing so far in this class,
    Kant’s view is that morality is not something that can be derived
    from examples.  What he wants is to find universal principles of
    morality that spring wholly from reason and not from experience. 
    This is why he calls his system *metaphysics of morals*.  In this
    section, Kant argues forcefully against utilitarian (or popular)
    moral theories, and he puts forward his own, absolutely binding
    moral principle: the categorical imperative.  In Kant’s ethical
    theory, a *categorical imperative* is a *universal command*, a
    principle that should be followed by anyone in any situation.  If a
    command like “always tell the truth” can be chosen and represents a
    moral rule we all should follow, then it has the status of a
    categorical imperative, and is therefore a duty.  Kant’s examples in
    this section are meant to show that actions can only be considered
    truly moral if they are motivated by the duty to follow this
    imperative.

     Instructions: Read the entire “Third Section” of Kant’s text.  In
    this section, Kant presents his view of what human freedom consists
    in, namely, following our rational principles rather than being
    guided by our appetite for please and our desire to avoid pain. 
    Because Kant has based both freedom and morality on rationality,
    this means that to be free is to be moral.  Or, in other words, to
    be free is to be bound by our duty to ourselves.

     Instructions: Watch the first half of this video until the lecture
    break at 22:25.  You will view the second part of this lecture in
    subunit 4.2.  While you watch this video lecture, consider the
    following question: can Kant possibly be right that it is *never*
    permissible to lie?  At first, Kant’s idea that duty and autonomy
    are compatible seems very counterintuitive.  In this lecture,
    Professor Sandel helps us make some sense of this view, and he
    applies it to the example of lying.  Ordinarily, we might think that
    lying is morally impermissible most of the time, unless it would
    help us avert some worse harm.  Kant famously denies this
    commonsense view, asserting that even if we were sure that some
    great harm was to result from our failing to tell a lie at the right
    moment, the lie would still be immoral, since it would mean that we
    failed to respect the moral law that springs from our rationality.

     Instructions: After reviewing the unit materials, please post and
    respond to the following topics on the course discussion board. 
    Feel free to start your own related posts, and respond to other
    students’ postings as well.  
      
     1. Philosophers who are critical of Kant have noted that Kant’s
    theory often leaves us with two conflicting duties.  Imagine a
    student who is trying to finish his college degree, and he then
    receives a phone call informing him that his mother has been
    diagnosed with cancer.  The student’s first instinct is to go home
    and take care of his mother.  His mother says, “stay, I want you to
    finish school, do not come home.”  How would Kant advise us in
    choosing between these two duties (duty to mother and duty to finish
    school)?  
      
      
     2. In the past, doctors would sometimes omit telling patients the
    truth about their condition.  For example, a patient diagnosed with
    a terminal illness who is about to leave on a long-awaited vacation
    might not be told about his terminal illness until he returned from
    his trip.  Such decisions by doctors are now considered to be
    unethical and a violation of the patient’s right to actively
    participate in his or her own treatment.  Do doctors have a duty to
    tell their patients the truth, no matter what? Why, or why not?  
        
     3. One of Kant’s famous examples, illustrating the need to always
    act from duty, is the two shopkeepers example: one shopkeeper gives
    correct change even when she might be tempted not to, whereas
    another shopkeeper always gives correct change but does it to be
    liked and because she wants to be elected to city council someday. 
    For Kant, the first shopkeeper without external motivation is
    actually more morally praiseworthy.  Does this same distinction
    apply to companies?  Should companies always act from the right
    intention, and not to increase their market share?  Explain your
    response.  
      
     Posting and responding on the discussion board should take
    approximately 5 hours to complete.
