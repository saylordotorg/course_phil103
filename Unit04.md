**Unit 4: John Rawls's Theory of Justice** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the 1970s, the late philosopher John Rawls put forward what is
widely considered to be the most important contemporary theory of
justice.  Rawls’s theory is a clever update of the traditional social
contract approach, but its starting point, rather than the natural
rights of individuals, is the deceptively simple idea of fairness.  Who
would disagree with the proposal that a just society should be a fair
one? *  
  
 *As we shall see in this unit, Rawls’s theory is both convincing and
controversial.  We will begin with Thomas Hobbes, one of the most
well-known proponents of social contract theory in the history of
philosophy.  For Hobbes, life before the social contract, or life before
government, is “nasty, brutish, and short.”  Hobbes makes this claim,
because he finds that human nature itself tends towards selfishness and
cruel treatment of others, especially without a contract with a
government that keeps the peace and punishes those who break contracts. 
Rawls has a somewhat more positive view of human nature: he is an
advocate of political liberalism, and his political philosophy conflicts
with many popular contemporary ideas and ideologies.  Therefore, we will
be looking at issues of equality in society and the questions of whether
certain social goods – such as income, education, and opportunity –
should be redistributed in order to ensure fairness.*

    describes what people are like in the absence of authority,
    especially government authority.  Hobbes finds that life before a
    social contract is inherently negative but that people will tend to
    seek social contracts and peace.  Hobbes finds that there are *laws
    of nature*, and these laws of nature will mitigate our destructive
    tendencies in the end.

    give up some of their rights to the sovereign, or to the great

**4.2 Social Contract Theory without the Contract: John Rawls** <span
id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: John Rawls is famous for devising a contemporary version of
social contract theory that does not rely on the existence of any actual
social contract or historical state of nature.  He is similar to Kant in
that he thinks we can derive a theory of justice from reason itself  by
imagining that we need to define the principles of a fair society
without knowing in advance what position we will occupy in that
society.  Rawls’s thought experiment is known as the* *veil of
ignorance.*

    kinds of agreements that are the hallmark of justice for Rawls and
    the foundation of civil society for Locke and Hobbes.  *Just laws*,
    which are laws that are in accord with justice, come from these
    kinds of agreements.  For Kant, contracts that generate justice are
    “ideas of reason.”  This allows Kant to provide an objective basis
    for contracts and laws, a way to describe laws as over and above
    subjective preferences.

**4.2.1 Overview of Rawls’s Theory of Justice** <span
id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The basic idea of Rawls’s theory of justice is that society
should be organized so that everyone has an equal share of rights,
liberties, opportunities, and wealth.  In other words, a just society is
a fair society.*

**4.2.2 Rawls’s Idea of the Original Position** <span
id="4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: Rawls aims to provide a theory of justice that is even more
general than that of Locke or Kant, since it is based on purely
hypothetical original position.  How would we choose to organize
society, if we had no idea what position we would have in it?  Rawls’s
idea is that we should try to make it as fair as possible so that no
matter what position we ended up in, we would have the same resources
and chances as everyone else.*

*Note: Societies in which success is a function of each individual’s
abilities, or* *meritocracies,gives an unfair advantage to those who are
born into positions of privilege or greater natural ability.  According
to Rawls, the technique of reasoning from the original position
demonstrates that social benefits will always need to be redistributed
in order to benefit the least well-off.*

     This lecture deals with a highly divisive issue, namely whether the
    wealth of the most successful members of society should be

    egalitarian approaches to this question, and he asks students to

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    article, which describes the key differences between retributive and
    restorative justice.  In social and political philosophy, there are
    traditionally two major types of justice: *distributive justice*
    describes how the status, wealth and goods in society will be
    portioned out from the beginning, and *retributive justice*
    describes punishments, penalties, and restitution for situations
    where someone wrongs someone else and breaks a social contract.  In
    recent years, retributive justice theory has been contrasted with
    restorative justice: retributive justice focuses on punishment and
    penalty, while restorative justice focuses on restitution and
    restoring community relationships.

    justice.  The question is, does affirmative action create a more
    just society by helping a disadvantaged group compete on a more
    level playing field, or is it, as its opponents claim, a form of
    *reverse racism*, because it singles out one group for special
    treatment?

    academic qualifications.  Thus, the plaintiffs argued that they had
    been discriminated against based on their race.  The court decided
    in their favor, and although the decision was later overturned, the

    argues that despite being denounced by people on opposite ends of
    the political spectrum, they both employ the same logic by treating
    race as a proxy.  If we want to have a coherent theory of
    distributive justice, then we need to get clear on the categories
    according to which social goods are distributed.

    Feel free to start your own related posts, and respond to other
    students’ postings as well.  
      
     1. In times of financial crisis, some governments have chosen to
    use debtor’s prisons as a way to both punish those persons who
    default on debts and as a deterrent to those who might willingly
    default on debts in the future.  Is this a legitimate use of the
    government’s power to punish those who break social contracts, in
    reference to Hobbes and Rawls?  Why, or why not?  
        
     2. Local governments in the past would sometimes not provide fire
    department services to members of the community; instead, private
    fire departments would sell yearly subscriptions as a form of fire
    insurance.  Is this a legitimate form of social contract, or would
    you argue that fire protection is so important to the public good
