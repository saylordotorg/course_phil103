**Unit 5: Ethics and Politics of Virtue** <span id="5"></span> 
*Prior to any of the theories we have considered so far, most accounts
of what it is for a person to be moral, or for a society to be just,
centered on some conception of virtue.  The most famous proponent of
virtue as the basis for living a good human life and creating a good
state is Aristotle.  Although recently, a growing number of
philosophers, as well as moral and political theorists, have been
returning to the concept of virtue as an antidote to what they interpret
as an over-emphasis on individual rights and freedoms and a neglect of
community and tradition in political thought since the Enlightenment.
 But can we as a society come to agree about what living virtuously
means?*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine Aristotle’s theory of a society
organized on the basis of virtue, as well as some modern communitarian
extensions of his general line of thought.  We will contrast Aristotle’s
notion of virtue with the existentialist concepts of* *will to power (as
in Friedrich Nietszche) and radical freedom and radical responsibility
(as in Jean-Paul Sartre).  We will see how these theories bear on the
topics of slavery, patriotism, and same-sex marriage. *

    Then, watch the remainder of the video lecture.  Professor Sandel
    addresses some of the arguments made in the debate over affirmative
    action as a form of distributive justice.  He then introduces
    Aristotle as an advocate of a very different theory of distributive
    justice, namely, that social goods, such as jobs, political
    positions, and material goods, should be distributed based on their
    purpose.  That is, Aristotle would argue that the University of
    Texas Law School should accept only those who are best suited to
    studying the law.

     Instructions: Read Book One of Aristotle’s *Politics* linked
    above.  Aristotle begins his political theory by investigating the
    forms of social political organization that existed during his
    lifetime. The relationship between men and women, masters and
    slaves, and households and the state, all come into existence in
    order to fulfill a certain purpose.  A well-organized society is,
    therefore, a society in which everyone fulfills their purpose and is
    thus given the opportunity to excel at the role to which they are
    best suited.

**5.2 Justice Is Respect for Virtue** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: Modern and contemporary theories of justice, such as those of
Mill, Kant, and Rawls, typically divorce the idea of justice from the
idea of virtue, implying that what virtues individual people possess
should not be a factor in deciding how to organize society.  Aristotle,
on the other hand, makes virtue the basis for his theory of justice. 
Distributive justice, in Aristotle’s account, becomes a way of honoring
people for their excellences of character.*

    break at 26:55.  You will view the second part of this lecture in
    subunit 5.6.  Aristotle’s notion of good personal ethics and virtue
    directly relates to his theory of the state.  The state has a vested
    interest in the virtuous behavior of the citizens who live in it, so
    the state has the power to make paternalistic laws that will
    moderate people’s behavior.  The purpose of the human being is to
    lead a virtuous, flourishing life, and the state has an interest in
    rewarding the virtuous development of those in the state.

    other than what they are best suited for?  Should they be denied
    that freedom in order to maintain an ideal society?  Or, is this
    curtailment of personal freedom itself unjust?  Aristotle’s
    surprising view of *natural slavery* has led many to accept the
    latter view.

     Instructions: Read Book Three of Aristotle’s *The Politics*.
     Aristotle begins by defining what the state is and what the
    conditions for citizenship are.  The second half of the book is
    devoted to the topic of justice, and it is here that Aristotle makes
    his famous argument about equality.  For Aristotle, justice is not
    simply a matter of respecting the equality of all citizens, but of
    determining in what specific ways people are said to be equal or
    unequal.

    Ethics* linked above.  In these passages, Aristotle discusses his
    idea that moral virtue is a matter of habit.  He also mentions that
    the role of good legislators is to instill good habits in the
    citizens they govern.  But in order for the legislators to help
    citizens develop their virtues, they would first need to know what
    it means to live virtuously and what specific virtues there are.

**5.4 Constrained Freedom: Justice within the Bounds of a Community**
<span id="5.4"></span> 
*Note: Kant agrees that the role of the state is to cultivate a virtuous
citizenry, but he disagrees that the state should decide in advance what
it means to be virtuous.  Instead, Kant advocates a framework in which
individuals are free to pursue their own visions of what the good life. 
Communitarians, inspired by Aristotle, resist Kant’s (and Rawls’s) view
of individual freedom as too radical and believe that some moral
obligations result from the communities of which individuals are a
part.*

MacIntyre turns to Aristotle, whose views about virtue predate the
Enlightenment emphasis on individual rights.*

    Then, continue watching the remainder of the video lecture.  Certain
    communitarian theories would urge that patriotism is an important
    component of justice and morality, since national traditions and a
    sense of collective belonging inform the identities of each citizen
    to some extent.  Critics of patriotismargue that it is a kind of
    prejudice at best, and at worst, can lead to persecution and
    injustice on a massive scale.  In this lecture, Professor Sandel
    explores the intricacies of this issue as students argue both for
    and against patriotism.

    consensus about what the good (in this case, the good for same-sex
    couples and other members of the moral community) is?  In this
    lecture, Professor Sandel makes the case that questions of morality
    and justice cannot be separated from questions about the good.  The
    problem, though, is that all members of a society seldom agree on
    what the good is.  This leads to a discussion of same-sex marriage,
    a hotly contested issue in the United States.

     Instructions: Read this ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme
    Judicial in the case of *Goodridge v. Department of Public Health*
    linked above.  In this case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
    court decided that marriage was a constitutionally-protected right
    of all citizens, including same-sex couples (at least within the
    state of Massachusetts).  The court grounded their arguments in the
    principles of due process and equal protection, both derived from
    the liberal tradition’s conception of freedom and quality.  This
    case prompted a string of state court decisions regarding same-sex
    marriage and sparked a national debate on the topic.

    lecture, starting at 10:23.  This lecture gives an introduction to
    Nietzsche’s critique of morality.  Nietzsche finds that modern
    morality is dominated by a limited view of Christian ethics as a
    passive and subservient rather than powerful.  He describes the
    *will to power* as a necessary part of living as a fully actualized
    *noble soul*.

     Instructions: Start the video after the lecture break at 24:40. 
    Then, watch the remainder of this video lecture.  In this lecture,
    Professor Sandel concludes the discussion of justice by asking what
    cases like same-sex marriage and abortion can tell us about the
    relation between morality and the law.  As you view this video
    lecture, consider the questions that follow.  Is it possible to
    legislate without imposing moral judgments and unfairly restricting
    freedoms?  In other words, can the government be neutral about
    divisive moral issues?

    Questions”**

    Questions”](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/unit-5-discussion-questions-3/)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: After reviewing the unit materials, please post and
    respond to the following topics on the course discussion board. 
    Feel free to start your own related posts, and respond to other
    students’ postings as well.  
      
     1. Consider someone with unusual opinions or unusual goals in life,
    for example, someone who chooses never to marry.  How does this
    person’s decision relate to existentialist ethics (as in Sartre’s
    radical freedom and radical responsibility)?  How should this person
    behave toward people he or she dates?  Explain your response.  
        
     2. How would you weigh economic arguments in favor of same-sex
    marriage?  For example, consider the argument that when people pair
    up and take care of each other in old age, it decreases financial
    burdens on our society and government as a whole.  Or, consider a
    student who is applying to college and filling out their financial
    aid paperwork.  If the student is the child of a same-sex couple,
    then is that student only obligated to report the lower income of
    one parent, because both parents are not legally married?  Is this
    fair to other students who must report the income of their
    opposite-sex married parents who need the same financial aid
    resources?  
      
     3. Should the state be able to involve itself in cases where
    citizens, who are adults and who are able to give informed consent,
    choose to harm themselves?  For example, note the different state
    policies on physician assisted suicide/euthanasia.  Explain your
    response.  
      
     Posting and responding on the discussion board should take
    approximately 5 hours to complete.
